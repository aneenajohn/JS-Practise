# Debounce VS Throttle

To create a mouse pointer, that runs after the user cursor, with a little offset from the cursor

Imagine, that we want to hide this pointer, after the user stops moving his mouse pointer, after 3 seconds. But if the user stops just for 1 or 2 seconds and we shouldnâ€™t hide the mouse pointer once user starts moving.
